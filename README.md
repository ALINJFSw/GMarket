<!-- project philosophy -->
<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

> A mobile app for connecting farmers and customers to sell their products directly, without the need for a middleman. 
>
> Green Market is a great way to support local farmers and get fresh, high-quality produce at a lower price. If you're looking for a more convenient and affordable way to shop for food, then this app is a great option for you.

### User Stories
- As a Farmer, I want to post my  offer about my production, so that let me offer my production without going to the market.
- As a Farmer, I want to join auctions, so I can have the best price for my product.
- As a customer, I want to search for production to buy, so I can choise the best quality and price.
